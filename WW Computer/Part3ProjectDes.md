# Project Code 3.1

In this portion of the project you will transition to working in teams. You will be submitting 1 code base repository with your solution. To prepare for that you need to be aware of the high level design that your team is using because after this you will be using ONE of your implementations moving forward.

## Last Feature(s)...I Promise?

Your existing WWC computer is missing one key feature: it needs support for parameters in *relative mode*.

Parameters in mode 2, *relative mode*, behave very similarly to parameters in *position mode*: the parameter is interpreted as a position. Like position mode, parameters in relative mode can be read from or written to.

The important difference is that *relative mode parameters don't count from address 0*. Instead, they count from a value called the *relative base*. The relative base starts at 0.

The address a relative mode parameter refers to is itself plus the current relative base. When the relative base is 0, relative mode parameters and position mode parameters with the same value refer to the same address.

For example, given a relative base of 50, a relative mode parameter of -7 refers to memory address 50 + -7 = 43.

The relative base is modified with the relative base offset instruction:

Opcode 9 adjusts the relative base by the value of its only parameter. The relative base increases (or decreases, if the value is negative) by the value of the parameter.

For example, if the relative base is 2000, then after the instruction 109,19, the relative base would be 2019. If the next instruction were 204,-34, then the value at address 1985 would be output.

## Your WWC computer will also need a few other capabilities

The computer's available memory should be much larger than the initial program. Memory beyond the initial program starts with the value 0 and can be read or written like any other memory. (It is invalid to try to access memory at a negative address, though.)

The computer should have support for large numbers. Some instructions near the beginning of this part's program will verify this capability.

## Here are some example programs that use these features

### Example 1
```
109,1,204,-1,1001,100,1,100,1008,100,16,101,1006,101,0,99
```
takes no input and produces a copy of itself as output.

### Example 2
```
1102,34915192,34915192,7,4,7,99,0
```
should output a 16-digit number.

### Example 3
```
104,1125899906842624,99
```
should output the large number in the middle.

## Challenge

This program will ask for a single input; run it in test mode by providing it the value 1. It will perform a series of checks on each opcode, output any opcodes (and the associated parameter modes) that seem to be functioning incorrectly, and finally output a keycode.

Once your WWC computer is fully functional, the program should report no malfunctioning opcodes when run in test mode; it should only output a single value, the keycode. What keycode does it produce?
