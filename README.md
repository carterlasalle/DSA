# Data Structures and Algorithms

A collection of Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Categories

### Sorting Algorithms
- Binary Search Implementation
- Ternary Search Implementation
- Bozosort (including multi-threaded version)

### Doomsday Algorithm
- Implementation of Conway's Doomsday Algorithm for calendar calculations

### Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)
- Transport Model Simulation
