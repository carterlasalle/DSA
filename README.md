## Handling structure.json updates

The `structure.json` file is automatically generated by GitHub Actions. To avoid conflicts when pulling changes:

1. Before making any local changes, always pull the latest changes from the remote repository:   ```
   git pull origin main   ```

2. If you encounter conflicts with `structure.json`, use the following commands:   ```
   git stash
   git pull --rebase origin main
   git stash pop   ```

3. If there are still conflicts after `git stash pop`, resolve them manually and commit the changes.

4. Always push your changes before making any updates that might trigger the GitHub Action:   ```
   git push origin main   ```

Remember, `structure.json` is ignored in the local repository to prevent conflicts. If you need to make changes to the folder structure, do so by modifying the actual folders and files, and let the GitHub Action update `structure.json`.
